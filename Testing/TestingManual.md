#### 1 User Testing
We carried out user testing by asking people to use the app and complete certain tasks, 
like signing in or out, adding and event or viewing by club or soc. After completing 
these tasks, we asked them to fill out a quick questionnaire. The results from it can 
be found below.

We also asked users for some general feedback. For the most part the users were happy with 
the app but we did receive a few pointers on the layout of the start time and end time 
fields on the add an event page. We learned a great deal from carrying out this user testing 
and we plan to incorporate all the feedback into making the app even better in the future.

#### 3 Testing the Buttons
We decided to check that all our buttons were working properly between both iOS and Android. 
To do this we simply launched the app and went through all the buttons, making sure when we 
clicked on a button it did the right thing and didn’t throw any errors. Thankfully, all of our 
buttons were working properly on both OS’s. Below you can see some screenshots from iOS and 
Android showing how the app moves between screens after the appropriate button is tapped.
